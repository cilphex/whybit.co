      <p><strong>Why Bitcoin</strong></p>

      <p>The year is 1998. You want to buy the new <i>Massive Attack</i> album,
      so you go to the store to purchase it. You exchange $20 for a plastic
      disc that you play in your car and in your room, and you are content.</p>

      <p>The year is 1999. You want to buy the new <i>Flaming Lips</i> album,
      but you realize that Napster exists now. Instead of driving to the store,
      you use the internet to download a digital copy for free, and you are
      content.</p>

      <p>What you have experienced in the timespan of 1 year is the impact of
      digital networking on information. Music is just information, and
      anything that is just information can be made digital. Things that are
      digital behave like light: they move fast, use little or no energy, and
      travel infinite distances.</p>

      <p>In practical terms, this means that anything that is just information
      can be made to be <i>fast</i>, <i>cheap</i>, and <i>global</i>
      (cross-border, without restriction).</p>

      <p>What is another example of something that is just information?</p>

      <p>Before the internet, exchanging written information meant needing
      paper and envelopes, placing something in a mailbox or post office,
      paying for a stamp, and being uncertain about delivery.</p>

      <p>But letters are just information. After the dawn of the internet,
      email has made letters fast, cheap, and global. They are sent instantly
      instead of taking days. They cost nothing, instead of a stamp price. And
      they can be sent and read anywhere. (Unlike postal mail, which is
      prevented depending on the source and destination jurisdictions.)</p>

      <p>Most practical accessories that people carry on their person are
      examples of things that are just information. Your bank account, your
      credit cards. They keys to your house and car. The <i>deeds</i> to your
      house and your car. Your social security number, health insurance card,
      driver's license, work access card and the watch on your wrist.</p>

      <p>Over time, all of these have or will fold into your phone. If you lose
      your wallet, these things are gone. If you lose your phone, they can be
      synced to your new one. All of these things are capable of being sent
      anywhere, instantly, at no cost, because they are just information.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The year is 2008. You want to send money to your family in Cuba. You
      select a payment processor and pay a $5 fee to send $50. It takes a week
      before the payment returns as rejected. You try again, same result.
      After much effort, you eventually find a way, at a great cost to your
      time and your wallet.</p>

      <p>But money is just information. Money is just an accounting system
      tracking value ownership claims. I have these tokens acting as claim
      to the output of the effort of others. She has more, they have less.
      Money is just numbers attached to names. It is just information.</p>

      <p>The year is 2009. You want to send money to your family in Cuba, but
      you realize that Bitcoin exists now. Instead of choosing a payment
      processor, you send bitcoin directly from your home laptop to your
      cousin's. The transfer takes 10 minutes to confirm, and you are
      content.</p>

      <br>

      <p>When Napster was released, it sparked a revolution in music.
      Digitization meant that nobody. But music and letters</p>
