      <p><strong>Why Bitcoin</strong></p>

      <!--
        TODO:
        Add 4th aspect: "without permission"
      -->

      <p>The year is 1998. You want to buy the new <em>Massive Attack</em> album,
      so you go to the store to purchase it. You exchange $20 for a plastic
      disc that you play in your car and in your room. You can't afford more,
      and if you don't have the disc you can't listen, but it's your only option
      for now.</p>

      <p>The year is 1999. You want to buy the new <em>Flaming Lips</em> album,
      but you realize that Napster exists now. Instead of purchasing the album
      from a store that you drive to, you use the internet to download a
      digital copy, for free. You can download more whenever, from wherever,
      and you are content.</p>

      <p>What you have experienced in the span of 1 year is a drastic
      change in one aspect of your life, made possible by the digitization
      of information.</p>

      <p>Music is just information, and
      anything that is just information can be made digital. Things that are
      digital behave like light: they move fast, use little or no energy, and
      travel infinite distances.</p>

      <p>This means that anything that is just information
      can be made to be <i>fast</i>, <i>cheap</i>, and <i>global</i>
      (cross-border, without restriction).</p>

      <p>What is another example of something that is just information?</p>

      <p>Before the internet, exchanging written information meant needing
      paper and envelopes, placing something in a mailbox or post office,
      paying for a stamp, and being uncertain about whether or not the mail
      would actually reach its destination.</p>

      <p>But letters are just information. Email has made letters fast,
      cheap, and global. Emails are sent instantly
      instead of taking days. They cost nothing, instead of a stamp price. And
      they can be sent and read anywhere. (Unlike postal mail, which is
      blocked or scanned depending on the source and destination.)</p>

      <p>Most practical accessories that people carry on their person are
      examples of things that are just information.</p>

      <p>Your bank account, your
      credit cards. They keys to your house and car. The <i>deeds</i> to your
      house and your car. Your social security number, health insurance card,
      driver's license, work access card and the watch on your wrist.</p>

      <p>Over time, all of these have or will fold into your phone. If you lose
      your wallet, these things take money and time to replace. If you lose
      your phone, they can be pulled from the cloud and synced to your new one
      for nothing.</p>

      <p>All of these things are capable of being stored and sent
      anywhere, instantly, at no cost, because they are just information.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The year is 2017. You want to send money to your family in the developing
      world. You
      select a payment processor and pay a $5 fee to send $50. It takes a week
      before the payment returns as rejected. You try again, same result.
      After much effort, you eventually find a way, at great cost to your
      time, your wallet, and your family's fortitude.</p>

      <p>The year is 2018...</p>

      <p>You want to send money to your family in the developing world, and
      you realize that digital currency exists now. Instead of choosing a payment
      processor, you send bitcoin directly from your phone to your
      cousin's. The transfer registers in seconds, for pennies, cross-border.</p>

      <p>What you have experienced in the span of 1 year is a drastic
      change in one aspect of your life, made possible by the digitization
      of information.</p>

      <p>Money is just information, like music, movies, and news.
      It is just an accounting system,
      tracking value ownership claims. I have these tokens acting as claim
      to the output of the effort of others. She has more, they have less.
      It is just numbers attached to names. It is just information. It can
      be digitized. And it can move with the speed and effortlessness of light.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Bitcoin is to money what napster was to music, what bittorrent was
      to movies, what email was to communication, and what websites were to
      news.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin is the informationization of money. It is the technology
      which moves this one aspect of our lives into something distributed
      and digital.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin is money for the information age.</p>

      <p>Now that it is here, we will never go back. All money will
      flow into digital currency because it is dramatically more efficient
      than all other forms of money. It is the socioeconomic path of least
      resistance.</p>
